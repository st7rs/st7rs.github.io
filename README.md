A personal ranker that allows you to rank and sort your own Top 7 for survival show ST7RS. It currently has functionality for adding and removing trainees on the table through click, sorting them on the ranking itself through drag & drop, and activating filters that show which contestants have been eliminated or currently hold a top 7 position. It is also possible to save a link of your current ranking to revisit it as the episodes progress.
